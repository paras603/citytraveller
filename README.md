# Design Principle Consideration
We apply the following design concepts to ensure a visually pleasing and user-friendly website:

1. Proximity: Group related items together for clear structure, such as placing package details next to photos.
2. Contrast: Use contrasting colors to highlight key information like "Popular Packages" and "More Nepal Packages."
3. Typography: Select legible fonts and maintain a consistent hierarchy for readability.
4. Alignment: Align content, such as in the 'How It Works' section, to create a tidy layout.
5. Repetition: Use consistent fonts and color palettes for a cohesive look.
These principles enhance both aesthetics and functionality, improving overall user experience.

1. Text Alternatives: Added text descriptions for images and multimedia to aid screen readers.
2. Color Contrast: Used high-contrast colors for text and backgrounds for better readability.
3. Semantic HTML: Used proper HTML tags to structure content, aiding screen readers.
4. Responsive Design: Made the site functional on various devices and screen sizes.
These strategies help create a more inclusive and user-friendly website.
